This is my practice for CNN implementation using Pytorch. Due to limited resource I have, I used transfer learning that uses pretrained model and modifies it for minimal revision for my task.
This notebook should run on both CPU-only and on GPU environments under below environments : 
Pytorch 2.5.1 
CUDA build 12.4.
